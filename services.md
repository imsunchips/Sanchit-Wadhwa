Howdy! I'm Sanchit Wadhwa.

I add value by making data valuable. Starting as a Data Analyst, and progressing along the way, I have learned to care about data. We all know data is valuable, but it is as valuable as its quality, availability, and usability. 

Is your data struggling? Let me help you and your team with the following services:
